# KareemDEV-Portfolio

## You could change `index.php` to `index.html`, and the portfolio will work serverless =>...
    But the "mail/send_email.php" won't work because HTML is just static! And also 
    by change it from ".php" to ".html", that might cause some problems in the UI.

## Important =>  You should better run the portfolio (`index.php`) with PHP server like that `php -S localhost:8000` not as a html file  =>...
    But you need to have "Composer" & "PHP" installed first on your machine of course.

## How to run my portfolio project (KareemDEV Portfolio) on your localhost?
    1) Install Composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/) PHP (https://windows.php.net/download) on your local machine
    2) Open the terminal or cmd in this current directory
    3) Type in the terminal or cmd => `php -S localhost:8000`
    4) Then open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000 or http://localhost:8000/index.php
    5) The page will load and show up everything
        * My portfolio project is a Single Page Application (SPA), so the "index.php" includes everything Home, About Me, Services, Work History, etc.
